I have previously discussed my [motivations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-03-27-personal-constitutions %}) for constructing, maintaining, and publishing my personal constitution.
Below is a brief recap & the most recent copy:


> We are what we eat, but at a higher abstraction level.
> Who we are and what we produce (concretely & abstractly; thoughts, behaviors, relationships, systems, etc) is heavily influenced by what we think.
> What we think is heavily influenced by what inputs we receive.
> What inputs we receive at time t are heavily influenced by the outputs we produce at time t-1.
> Thus, the effect of repeated inputs in your life compound over time.
>
> ...
>
> My document serves two main purposes:
> 1. it is a single location where I collect my thoughts about what I believe to be true, what kind of person I wish to be, and what kind of life I wish to live; and
> 2. it is a source of feedback when I review it, both to question how closely I have lived up to my ideals in the past, and to plant seeds for the future.
>
> ...
>
> It is a deeply personal document, and while some elements I believe are timeless, others may only relate to specific, temporary circumstances I am fixated on or struggling with today.
> I am publishing it to serve as a potential source of inspiration for others, and also as a filter for inbound communication.

Be deliberate with your Presence. Accept what Is. Surrender to what you cannot change.<br>
Meaning and reality are not fixed; continually reassess. Nebulous-yet-patterned.<br>
Life has asked of you, ‘what is your meaning?’ How will you choose to answer?<br>
Meaning requires context and agency.<br>
Love is the Mother of all Virtues. Pride is the Father of all Vices.<br>
The world is my country, all mankind are my brethren.<br>
Trust is the most valuable asset in the world.<br>
Be impeccable with the Word.<br>
Reputation comes from consistency.<br>
Take extreme ownership.<br>
Seek understanding; don’t criticize, don’t assume.<br>
Stop trying to ‘fix’ the people closest to you. Give them space to be. Accept who they are, not who you have imagined in your head they will become.<br>
Make the implicit explicit.<br>
Be emphatic. Listen. Observe. Beginner’s mind. Step outside your own context.<br>
The greatest fool of all is the man who fools himself, and you are the easiest person to fool.<br>
Be wary of emotional hijacking. <br>
Beliefs are hypotheses to be tested, not treasures to be guarded.<br>
I don't know what I don't know. Embrace uncertainty and humility.<br>
Experience::knowledge::ignorance.<br>
Be deliberate with your time and focus. Before every task ask, “is this worth my attention?” [if not hell yeah, then no; 60% rounds down]<br>
Produce. Finding work you love is difficult. Mind the effort gap.<br>
Feedback loops enable sums greater than parts.<br>
Predict => act => observe => learn => predict => …<br>
Break complex tasks into simple tasks. Repeat as needed.<br>
List, rank, iterate.<br>
Teaching is the best way to learn.<br>
Defeating The Struggle is where greatness comes from.<br>
Embrace the Void. Stop clinging.<br>
Have self-compassion. I am enough.<br>
We, not I.<br>
Appreciate those around you; be grateful.<br>
Diversity is the basis for collective intelligence.<br>
A man is revealed by how he treats the powerless.<br>
You must be willing in your heart to begin again every day. Commit willingly.<br>
Perfect is the enemy of done.<br>
Patience. There are always more opportunities.<br>
All in moderation.<br>
Power with brevity.<br>
Focus with subtraction.<br>
Actions over words.<br>
Do, then research.<br>
Habits over choices. Reduce friction.<br>
Align body desires with logical desires. Use dopamine.<br>
Imagination is the interface to your attitude<br>
What am I afraid of today? Be honest with yourself. Be vulnerable.<br>
Beware bikeshedding. <br>
Recognize the importance of the next task. Make today a positive feedback loop.<br>
The hardest part is getting started. Lower the stakes. Pomodoro?<br>
Protect your dopamine.<br>
Building emrys is your job. An entrepreneur without a company is just unemployed.<br>
<br>
Watch your thoughts for they become words,<br>
watch your words for they become actions,<br>
watch your actions for they become habits,<br>
watch your habits for they become your character,<br>
watch your character for it becomes your destiny.<br>
<br>
We all stumble. Forgive yourself, and get back up.<br>
