I have previously discussed my [motivations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-03-27-personal-constitutions %}) for constructing, maintaining, and publishing my personal constitution.
Below is a brief recap & the most recent copy:


> We are what we eat, but at a higher abstraction level.
> Who we are and what we produce (concretely & abstractly; thoughts, behaviors, relationships, systems, etc) is heavily influenced by what we think.
> What we think is heavily influenced by what inputs we receive.
> What inputs we receive at time t are heavily influenced by the outputs we produce at time t-1.
> Thus, the effect of repeated inputs in your life compound over time.
> ...
> My document serves two main purposes:
> 1. it is a single location where I collect my thoughts about what I believe to be true, what kind of person I wish to be, and what kind of life I wish to live; and
> 2. it is a source of feedback when I review it, both to question how closely I have lived up to my ideals in the past, and to plant seeds for the future.
> ...
> It is a deeply personal document, and while some elements I believe are timeless, others may only relate to specific, temporary circumstances I am fixated on or struggling with today.
> I am publishing it to serve as a potential source of inspiration for others, and also as a filter for inbound communication.

Be present. Accept. Surrender.  
Meaning and reality are not fixed; continually reassess. Nebulous-yet-patterned.  
Life has asked of you, ‘what is your meaning?’ How will you choose to answer?  
Be impeccable with the Word.  
Love is the Mother of all Virtues. Pride is the Father of all Vices.  
The world is my country, all mankind are my brethren.  
Trust is the most valuable asset in the world.  
Seek understanding; don’t criticize, don’t assume.  
Be emphatic. Listen. Observe. Beginner’s mind.  
The greatest fool of all is the man who fools himself, and you are the easiest person to fool.  
Beliefs are hypotheses to be tested, not treasures to be guarded.  
I don't know what I don't know. Embrace uncertainty and humility.  
Experience::knowledge::ignorance.  
Be deliberate with your time and focus. Before every task ask, “is this worth my attention?”  
Produce. Finding work you love is difficult.  
Act => observe => learn => act => …  
Feedback loops enable sums greater than parts.  
Teaching is the best way to learn.  
Defeating The Struggle is where greatness comes from.  
Everything looks like a failure in the middle.  
Have self-compassion. I am enough.  
We, not I.  
Appreciate those around you; be grateful.  
Diversity is the basis for collective intelligence.  
A man is revealed by how he treats the powerless.  
Reputation comes from consistency.  
You must be willing in your heart to begin again every day. Commit willingly.  
Perfect is the enemy of done.  
Patience. There are always more opportunities.  
All in moderation.  
Power with brevity.  
Habits over choices. Reduce friction.  
What am I afraid of today? Be honest with yourself. Be vulnerable.  
Recognize the importance of the next task. Make today a positive feedback loop.  
  
Watch your thoughts for they become words,  
watch your words for they become actions,  
watch your actions for they become habits,  
watch your habits for they become your character,  
watch your character for it becomes your destiny.
