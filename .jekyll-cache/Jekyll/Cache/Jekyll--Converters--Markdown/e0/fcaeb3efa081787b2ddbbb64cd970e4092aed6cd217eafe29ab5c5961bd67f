I"”<p>Before beginning a journey, it is important to choose a destination. The destination may be concrete or abstract, but it must be well-defined. If it isnâ€™t, how will you know if youâ€™re off-track, or if youâ€™ve arrived? â€œMy destination is nowhereâ€ is explicit, and so acceptable. But if your destination is somewhere, further definition is paramount. Even the wise men needed a north star.</p>
