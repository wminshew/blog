I"ù<p>Avid reader, fledgling writer. In love with strategic games, computers, math, &amp; science since as early as I can remember; more recently, exploring economics, finance, game theory, and intelligence.</p>

<p>Will take time to find the right cadence; I hope you‚Äôll bear with me. I intend to focus on abstract yet useful mental models.</p>

<p>All the best on your journey. Perhaps we‚Äôll meet one day.</p>
