Avid reader, fledgling writer. In love with strategic games, computers, math, & science since as early as I can remember; more recently, exploring economics, finance, game theory, and intelligence.

Will take some time to find the right cadence; I hope you will bear with me. I intend to keep this blog focused on abstract, yet highly useful, mental models.

All the best on your journey. Perhaps we'll meet one day.
